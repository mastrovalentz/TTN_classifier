# TTN references

In this folder some of the works we used to study the correct way to implement a TTN classifier are presented:

- **1605.05775.pdf** discuss how a tensor networks can be used in the supervised learining task

- **2004.13747.pdf** presents the result of the implementation of Tree Tensor Netowrks for the binary classification task over an LHCb dataset

- **1402.4735.pdf** is the original paper from the Baldi group where the binary classification task over the dataset we used is discussed using Neural Networks
